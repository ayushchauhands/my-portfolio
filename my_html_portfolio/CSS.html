    <p>
      We use CSS to add style to our HTML documents. There are different ways to
      add CSS to a document but for the time being we will be using
      <em>inline</em> CSS
    </p>
    <h2>Inline CSS</h2>
    <p>Inline CSS is written directly in our HTML using a style attribute.</p>
    <p>
      We can style any element using inline styles, from the body to headings
      and paragraphs, as well as links and strong and em tags too.
