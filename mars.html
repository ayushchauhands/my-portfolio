    <p>Mars is the <strong>fourth planet from the Sun</strong></p>
    <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
    <h3>Orbit</h3>
    <p>
      Mars's average distance from the Sun is roughly 230 million km (143
      million mi), and its orbital period is 687 (Earth) days. The solar day (or
      sol) on Mars is only slightly longer than an Earth day: 24 hours, 39
      minutes, and 35.244 seconds. A Martian year is equal to 1.8809 Earth
      years, or 1 year, 320 days, and 18.2 hours
    </p>
    <h3>Rotation</h3>
    <p>
      Mars rotation is 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35 seconds if you are
      interested in the solar day or 24 hours, 37 minutes and 22 seconds for the
      sidereal day. Since the planet only rotates about 40 minutes slower than
      Earth, this is one category where the two planets are not very different.
      Mars, like all of the planets except Venus, rotates in prograde(counter
      clockwise). The planet has a rotational speed of 868.22 km/h at the
      equator. The similarity if the length of the day allows the engineers as
      NASA to switch their day to a ”Mars day” when they are working with rovers
      on the planet. This maximizes their time with the equipment, but
      drastically changes their actual Earth schedule. They end up working an
      ever changing day as the Martian/Earth day difference accumulates.
