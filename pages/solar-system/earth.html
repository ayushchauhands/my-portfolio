      Earth is <strong> third planet from the Sun</strong> and the
      <strong>astronomical object known to harbor life</strong>.

    <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
    <h3>Rotation</h3>
    <p>
      Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is 86,400
      seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seconds). Because Earth's solar
      day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to
      tidal deceleration, each day varies between 0 and 2 ms longer than the
      mean solar day.
    </p>
    <h3>Orbit</h3>
    <p>
      Earth orbits the Sun, making Earth the third-closest planet to the Sun and
      part of the inner Solar System. Earth's average orbital distance is about
      150 million km (93 million mi), which is the basis for the Astronomical
      Unit and is equal to roughly 8.3 light minutes or 380 times Earth's
      distance to the Moon.
